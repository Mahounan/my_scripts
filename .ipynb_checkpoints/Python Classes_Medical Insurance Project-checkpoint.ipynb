    "# You have been asked to develop a system that makes it easier to organize patient data. You will create a class that does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Takes in patient parameters regarding their personal information\n",
    "# Contains methods that allow users to update their information\n",
    "# Gives patients insight into their potential medical fees.\n",
    "# Let’s get started!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1.\n",
    "# If you look at script.py, you will see that we have started a class called Patient. It currently has an __init__ method with two class variables: self.name and self.age.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Let’s start by adding in some more patient parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "# sex: patient’s biological identification, 0 for male and 1 for female\n",
    "# bmi: patient BMI\n",
    "# num_of_children: number of children patient has\n",
    "# smoker: patient smoking status, 0 for a non-smoker and 1 for a smoker\n",
    "# Add these into the __init__ method so that we can use them as we create our class methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2.\n",
    "# Let’s test out our __init__ method and create our first instance variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create an instance variable outside of our class called patient1.\n",
    "\n",
    "# patient1 = Patient(\"John Doe\", 25, 1, 22.2, 0, 0)\n",
    "# Next, print out the name of patient1 using the following line of code:\n",
    "\n",
    "# print(patient1.name)\n",
    "# Print out the rest of patient1’s information to ensure the __init__ method is functioning properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Adding Functionality with Methods\n",
    "# 3.\n",
    "# Now that our constructor is built out and ready to go, let’s start creating some methods! Our first method will be estimated_insurance_cost(), which takes our instance’s parameters (representing our patient’s information) and returns their expected yearly medical fees.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Below the __init__ constructor, define our estimated_insurance_cost() constructor which only takes self as an argument. Inside of this method, add the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "# estimated_cost=250∗age−128∗sex+370∗bmi+425∗num_of_children+24000∗smoker−12500\n",
    "# Note that we are using class variables in our formula here, so be sure to remember to use the self keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4.\n",
    "# Inside of our estimated_insurance_cost() method, let’s add a print statement that displays the following in the terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "# {Patient Name}’s estimated insurance costs is {estimated cost} dollars.\n",
    "# Then, test out this method using the patient1 instance variable.\n",
    "\n",

    "# 5.\n",

    "\n",
    "# What if our patient recently had a birthday? Or had a fluctuation in weight? Or had a kid? Let’s add some methods that allow us to update these parameters and recalculate the estimated medical fees in one swing.\n",
    "\n",
    "# First, create an update_age() method. It should take in two arguments: self and new_age. In this method reassign self.age to new_age.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6.\n",
    "# Let’s flesh out this method some more!\n",

    "# self.estimated_insurance_cost()\n",
    "# Test out your method with patient1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 8.\n",
    "# Let’s make another update method that modifies the num_of_children parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Below the update_age() method, define a new one called update_num_children(). This method should have two arguments, self and new_num_children. Inside the method, self.num_of_children should be set equal to new_num_children.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 9.\n",
    "# Similarly to the method we wrote before, let’s add in a print statement that clarifies the information that is being updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Your print statement should output the following in the terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "# {Patient Name} has {Patient’s Number of Children} children.\n",
    "# Use the patient1 instance variable to test out this method. Set the new_num_children argument to 1. Do you notice anything strange about the output?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 10.\n",
    "# You may have noticed our terminal output is grammatically incorrect because John Doe only has 1 child. Let’s update our method to accurately convey when we should use the noun “children” versus when we should use “child”.\n",
    "\n",
    "# To do this we can use control flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "# If the patient has 1 offspring, we should see the following output:\n",
    "\n",
    "# {Patient Name} has {Patient Number of Children} child.\n",
    "# Otherwise, we should see this output:\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Storing Patient Information\n",
    "# 12.\n",
    "# Let’s create one last method that uses a dictionary to store a patient’s information in one convenient variable. We can use our parameters as the keys and their specific data as the values.\n",

    "# 14.\n",
    "# Congratulations! You have successfully made a powerful Patient class! Classes are an incredibly useful programming tool because they allow you to create a blueprint that can be used to build many objects off of.
